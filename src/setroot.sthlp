{title:Description}

{pstd}
Use {cmd:setroot} to improve the reproductibility of your research,
by ensuring that all code and files are accessed with respect to
the top-level directory of your project, instead of using hardcoded or relative paths.

{pstd}
{cmd:setroot} first finds the root or top-level folder of your project by searching for common filenames in the working directory.
It then saves this name to the global variable $root, so it can be used to build file paths.
{cmd:setroot} first searches the working directory for a set of filenames,
and then searches any subsequent parent directories until a matching file is found,
stopping with an error if not.

{pstd}
Using this package has two advantages:

{pmore}
1. It ensures your code is portable across computers and coauthors, as it avoids hardcoded paths.
So instead of "C:/Users/John/MyPaper/data/xyz.dta",
you just need to use the string "$root/data/xyz.dta".

{pmore}
2. It makes code less fragile, as it can be moved to subdirectories without the need to change all any relative paths.

{pstd}
{cmd:findroot} is heavily inspired by the {browse "https://here.r-lib.org/":here} R package and
the {browse "https://github.com/korenmiklos/here":Stata package} of the same name.

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt more} Will create additional variables, including $code, $data, $input, $output, $log, and $temp in the root folder, and $figures and $tables as subfolders of $output.
These names are based on the suggested folder structure by {browse "https://www.stata.com/bookstore/data-analysis-using-stata/":Data Analysis Using Stata}.

{phang}
{opt loc:al} Saves local variables instead of global variables.

{phang}
{opt search(files_or_folders)} Allows you to customize the files or folders that will be searched within the working directory.
By default, the files searched are:{res}
.here .project .git DESCRIPTION LICENSE README.md project.toml manifest.toml pyproject.toml{txt}

{phang}
{opt add(file)} Creates an empty filename in the working directory that can be used as a reference in the future..
Recommended usage is {cmd:setroot, add(.here)}.

{pstd}
This work is heavily based on R's {cmd:here} package, as well as on Mikl√≥s Koren's Stata port.
Thank you in advance for bug-spotting and feature suggestions.{p_end}
